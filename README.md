Animated meme "Hand in there Pixeldog" to be able to have a interactive background picture.

https://n.ethz.ch/~fdoebele/swingingDog/

plans for the future:
-change the black background that it is transparent
-if dog gets grabbed to often -> put a dead dog picture in there and change the text snippet
-if dog doesnt gets attention for a long time -> put a starving dog (skeleton) as the picture
-get the rope to bend like a real rope
-maybe try to do it in 3D
