Animated meme "Hang in there PixelDog" to be able to have a interactive background picture.

https://n.ethz.ch/~fdoebele/swingingDog/

plans for the future:  
-if dog gets grabbed to often -> put a dead dog picture in there and change the text snippet  
-add a ghost dog?  
-if dog doesnt gets attention for a long time -> put a starving dog (skeleton) as the picture  
-get the rope to bend like a real rope  
-maybe try to do it in 3D

already done:  
-hanging dog on a rope that can be interacted with  
-change the black background that it is transparent
